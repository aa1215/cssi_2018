# CSSI Curriculum Labs

During the summer before my freshman year of college, I was selected to participate in Google's Computer Science Summer Institute. I believe this was a transformative experience in knowing that I wanted to pursue computer science as a career and gave me a lot of the technical foundations for my computer science education. I loved getting to collaborate with like-minded students on fun projects and labs throughout the course of the program. This repository has all of my labs and work from the program. My final project is in another repository.
